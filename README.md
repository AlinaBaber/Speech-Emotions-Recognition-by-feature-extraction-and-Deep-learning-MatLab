# Speech Emotion Recognition Using Feature Extraction and Deep Learning (MatLab)

This repository presents a comprehensive thesis project on **Speech Emotion Recognition** using a combination of feature extraction techniques and **Deep Learning** in **MATLAB**. The research focuses on analyzing speech data from both normal and autistic subjects to classify emotions (Angry, Happy, Neutral, Sad) and detect language disorders.

The project introduces the first-ever **Urdu speech dataset** for emotion recognition, created in collaboration with local medical experts. The dataset is balanced and covers diverse emotional states, making it a valuable contribution to the field of speech processing.

   - Collected from normal and autistic subjects.
   - Balanced across four emotions: Angry, Happy, Neutral, Sad.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Includes pitch contour, rate of acceleration, formant frequencies, intensity, MFCC, LPCC, Rasta PLP, and more.
   - Comprehensive analysis of audio signal characteristics like frequency, intensity, formants, and energy.
3. **Emotion Recognition**:
   - Classification of emotions using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Neural Networks (NN)**, and a **Hybrid Model**.
   - Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for speech disorder recognition.
4. **MATLAB Implementation**:
   - Feature extraction and classification performed using MATLAB‚Äôs powerful signal processing and machine learning libraries.
5. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Comparison of normal and autistic speech patterns at the audio signal level.
   - Detailed error rates and performance metrics for classification algorithms.
